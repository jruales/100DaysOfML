# 100 Days Of ML - Log

Rules: https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code

## Day 1: July 16, 2018
 
**Today's Progress**:

Continuing to read through "Hands-On Machine Learning with Skikit-Learn & Tensorflow" 1st Edition by Aurélien Géron. Going through Chapter 2 (End-to-End Machine Learning Project) pages 66-72, learning about custom transformers, feature scaling, transformation pipelines, training and evaluating models, and using cross-validation. All of these in Scikit-Learn.

**Thoughts**: I'm currently focusing on Chapter 2 (End-to-End Machine Learning Project) to make sure I have my foundations in terms of data preparation and Scikit-Learn.

## Day 0: July 15, 2018
 
**Today's Progress**: Set up this git repo after I learned about this challenge.

**Thoughts**: Seems like a cool challenge. I especially hope this challenge will allow me to practice the hands-on side of Machine Learning (my past focus has been a lot on theory and algorithms).
